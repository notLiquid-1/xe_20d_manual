</div>
<p>Always install covers to protect the fenders before commencing work in the engine compartment. Always install the interior protection kit, wear clean overalls and wash hands or wear gloves before working inside the vehicle. Avoid spilling hydraulic fluid, antifreeze or battery acid on the paintwork. In the event of spillage, wash off with water immediately. Use polythene sheets in the luggage compartment to protect carpets. Always use the recommended service tool, or a satisfactory equivalent, where specified. Protect temporarily exposed screw threads by replacing nuts or installing caps.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Vehicle in Workshop</div>
</div>
<p>When working on a vehicle in the workshop always make sure that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The parking brake is applied or the wheels are securely chocked to prevent the vehicle moving forwards or backwards</li>
<li>If the engine is to be run, there is adequate ventilation, or an extraction hose to remove exhaust fumes is installed</li>
<li>There is adequate room to jack up the vehicle and remove the wheels, if necessary</li>
<li>Fender covers are always installed if any work is to be carried out in the engine compartment</li>
<li>The battery is disconnected if working on the engine, underneath the vehicle, or if the vehicle is jacked up</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="caution-alert">CAUTION:</div>

</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Unless stated otherwise, self-locking nuts once removed must be discarded and new nuts of the same type strength grade installed.</li>
<li>Damaged nuts, bolts and screws must always be discarded. Attempting to recut or repair damaged threads with a tap or die impairs the strength and fit of the threads and is not recommended.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTES:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p> During certain repair operations, it may be necessary to remove traces of thread locking agents using a tap. Where this is necessary, the instruction to do so will appear in the relevant operation and it is essential that a tap of the correct size and thread is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Taptite bolts when used cut their own threads on the first application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Some bolts are coated with a thread locking agent and unless stated otherwise, they must not be reused. New bolts having the same part number as the original must always be installed. When nuts or bolts are to be discarded, the repair operation and relevant torque chart will include an instruction to that effect. Do not use proprietary thread locking agents as they may not meet the specification required. See also Encapsulated ('Patched') Bolts and Screws.</li>
<li>Always make sure that replacement nuts and bolts are at least equal in strength to those that they are replacing. Castellated nuts must not be loosened to accept a split pin except in recommended cases when this forms part of an adjustment.</li>
<li>Do not allow oil or grease to enter blind holes, the hydraulic action resulting from tightening the bolt or stud can split the housing and also give a false torque reading.</li>
<li>Always tighten a nut, bolt or screw to the specified torque figure, damaged or corroded threads can give a false torque reading.</li>
<li>Nut and bolt loosening and tightening sequences, where given, must ALWAYS be followed. Distortion of components or faulty sealing of joints will result if the sequences are not followed. Where an instruction is given to tighten in stages, these stages must be adhered to; do not attempt to combine stages particularly where certain stages involve tightening by degrees.</li>
<li>To check or re-tighten a fixing to a specified torque, first loosen a quarter of a turn, then re-tighten to the specified torque figure.</li>
<li>Unless instructed otherwise, do not lubricate bolt or nut threads prior to installing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where it is stated that bolts and screws may be reused, the following procedures must be carried out: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Check that threads are undamaged.</li>
<li>Remove all traces of locking agent from the threads.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">

<p>If a vehicle is to be scrapped, undeployed airbag modules and pre-tensioner units must be manually deployed. In this case airbags can be deployed in the vehicle. Before deployment, make sure the airbag module is secure within its correct mounting position. Deployment of the driver's airbag in the vehicle may damage the steering wheel; if the vehicle is not being scrapped, deploy the module outside of the vehicle.</p>

<ul class="wcn-list">
<li>
<p>The Restraints Control Module (RCM) will log a crash fault after every impact which is severe enough to cause airbag deployment. <span class="bold-black">It is possible to have three crashes/impacts logged after one event where, for example, a front, side and rollover has occurred. After the third fault is logged, the SRS warning lamp will be illuminated and the RCM must be installed. After any airbag deployment a new RCM must be installed. </span>
