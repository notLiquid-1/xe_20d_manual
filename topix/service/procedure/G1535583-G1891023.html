</div>
<h2>Standards</h2>
<p>Vehicles may require storage for varying periods of time before the customer takes delivery. It is essential that a new Jaguar vehicle is stored correctly, in order to ensure total customer satisfaction after the car is removed from storage and prepared for sale.</p>
<p>This document establishes the MINIMUM STANDARDS required of franchise holders and appointed vehicle storage companies by Jaguar Land Rover Limited for the storage of new vehicles, and may only be deviated from with the Company&rsquo;s agreement. Any concerns should be discussed with your Franchise Regional Manager.</p>
<p>This information should be used in conjunction with the relevant Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) information. </p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</div>
</div>
<h2>Preventative Measures</h2>
<p>Adequate preventative measures must be taken to ensure that each vehicle in stock is maintained in peak condition.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">ARRIVAL</span>
</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to notify delivery companies immediately of any losses and/or transit damage identified on receipt of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Where applicable, Vehicle Condition Reports (VCR&rsquo;s) must be endorsed accordingly, otherwise it is unlikely that the transit insurance company will accept any claims for missing items or damage rectification.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">STORAGE</span>
</p>
<p>Correct preparation of vehicles for storage is essential. The majority of new vehicles leaving Jaguar Land Rover Limited are provided with the appropriate protection for transit. It is your responsibility to make sure that a vehicle storage department, or specialist company, is sufficiently equipped to undertake the storage requirements endorsed in this publication. <span class="bold-black">Whilst vehicles are in storage, any deterioration or damage sustained is the sole responsibility of the storage operator and must NOT be made the subject of a warranty claim.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">DISPATCH</span>
</p>
<p>When removing vehicles from storage, you are responsible for procedures that ensure they are in a safe and roadworthy condition.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">VEHICLE STORAGE</div>
</div>
<h2>VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION UPON ARRIVAL</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="bold-black">A New Vehicle Storage History Sheet must be raised for every new vehicle upon arrival and should remain inside the vehicle until despatch. This must contain a record of the vehicle condition and any rectification work carried out during the storage period (see Storage History Sheet).</span>
</li>
<li>Vehicles must be checked for correct specification and/or shortages. Where this is incorrect the required parts should be procured through normal channels and costs claimed back via the Jaguar Land Rover claims submission system using the appropriate shortage or misbuild program code.</li>
<li>Claims for rectifying incorrect specification items and/or shortages must be made in accordance with the conditions detailed in Section C of the Warranty Policy and Procedures Manual. </li>
<li>Ignition and door keys must be suitably labeled and when the vehicle is locked, they must be held in a suitably identified and secure office. All key numbers must be recorded on the New Vehicle Storage History Sheet. All keys, including spares, must be removed from the vehicle during storage for security reasons.</li>
<li>During storage the vehicle must remain in transport mode, except for carrying out the battery check procedure.</li>
</ol>
<h2>VEHICLE INSPECTION</h2>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Vehicle Protection</p>
<p> Category 1 - Drivers Side Door - Rapguard + Blue Foam.</p>
</div>
<p> Category 2 - Land Rover - Bonnet Glove + Cat 1. Jaguar - Bonnet + Roof + Tailgate Glove + Cat 1.</p>
<p> Category 3 - Full Body Cover + Cat1.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Vehicles not fitted with Cat 3 body inspection</p>
<p>The entire vehicle exterior must be inspected and, if necessary, washed thoroughly, including the underside and wheel arches, to remove all dirt and mud deposits.</p>
</div>
<p>Any defects found during inspection must be rectified before the vehicle is stored.</p>
<p> Make sure that bumper and body side protectors are correctly fitted.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Vehicles fitted with Cat 3 body inspection</p>
<p>The body protection cover is to be inspected for damage, if any damage is observed then inspect the area of the vehicle for damage.</p>
</div>
<p>Delivery damage is not the responsibility of Jaguar Land Rover and must not be made the subject of a warranty claim. It is the responsibility of the Dealer/Retailer or vehicle storage company to identify any such damage at the time of the new vehicle receipt and to make sure that the full details are recorded on the Delivery Receipt. Claims for rectification of such damage must be directed to the Delivery Company. </p>
<p>Failure to notify the Delivery Company of damage details at the time of vehicle delivery will result in claims for subsequent rectification being rejected. </p>
<p>Warranty claims for damage repairs may only be submitted where Jaguar Land Rover's responsibility is clearly indicated.</p>
<p> Examples falling into this category are paintwork damage during the fitment of trim or outward facing dents on the door skin.</p>
<p>Warranty claims will not be accepted for any transit damage repaired or identified after the vehicle has been placed into service.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">IDEALLY ALL VEHICLES SHOULD BE STORED IN A WELL VENTILATED AND TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED BUILDING.</span>
</p>
<p>However, it is recognized that the majority of all vehicle storage is done in an open compound. Therefore, the following site requirements must be observed and should be authorised with your Regional Manager.</p>
<ol>
<li>The site should have a level well-drained hard standing surface, preferably concrete or tarmac. This must be free from loose/sharp edges and any contaminates that may lead to tire damage.</li>
<li>The site and driveways must be kept clean and clear of any obstruction at all times.</li>
<li>The site must be enclosed by a secure intruder-proof perimeter fence and the gates securely locked. The site should be under daily surveillance, with unauthorized access prevented at all times.</li>
<li>The site should be located away from areas subject to industrial fallout, sea spray or wind-blown dust and sand. Where fallout conditions are unavoidable it will be necessary to monitor the exterior condition of all cars and wash as necessary.</li>
<li>Mains water, tire inflation and battery charging facilities must be available on site.</li>
<li>Hedges, shrubs and trees adjacent to the site should be kept trimmed and clear of parked vehicles.</li>
<li>Vehicles must not be parked under trees, overhead cables or other overhanging structures as bird droppings or other types of contamination could occur.</li>
</ol>
<h2>VEHICLE PARKING</h2>
<p>Vehicles must be parked tidily with 300 mm (1 foot) between bumpers, front and rear.</p>
<p>Vehicles must be parked 750 mm (2.5 feet) away from any fixed obstacle (for example a wall or fence)</p>
<p>Vehicles must be moved on a first-in-first-out basis, subject to specification.</p>

<p>The storage, handling and charging of batteries is not dangerous provided that the relevant battery manufacturers&rsquo; recommendations are followed. However, a suitable storage and charging facility must be available and should be in accordance with local legal requirements.</p>
<h2>COOLING SYSTEM</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It is ESSENTIAL to maintain the concentration of anti-freeze at the factory-fill condition. Failure to do so may cause oxidization of the cooling system leading to corrosion of the engine and heater.</li>
<li>The coolant level is to be checked in line with the 30, 60 and 90 day process, to make sure the coolant is at the correct level in the expansion tank.</li>
<li>If the temperature has fallen below -40&deg;C the coolant system must be checked for leaks before starting the engine.</li>
<li>If the vehicle is to be started between the 30, 60 and 90 day process the coolant level must be checked before the engine is started.</li>
<li>The coolant mixture specification is 50% plain water and 50% Jaguar Land Rover anti-freeze, Coolant and Corrosion Inhibitor for frost protection down to -36&deg;C (-33&deg;F).</li>
</ul>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Cooling system top up process</p>
<p>If required follow the below process to top up the cooling system proceed as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Carefully examine the radiator and all hoses for leaks and security of hose clamps.</li>

<li>Run the air conditioning system for minimum of 5 continuous minutes with the engine at idle</li>
</ol>
<h2>TIRES</h2>
<p>For storage purposes, tires on fitted wheels must be inflated to and maintained at a maximum pressure of 3.60 bar (52 lbf/in2).</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Wheels must be rotated through 180 degrees in the forward direction monthly, to ensure that the tread is rotated evenly during the storage period</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The spare wheel tire pressure must be maintained at the appropriate pressure specified in the Owners Handbook.</p>
<p>Tire condition should be inspected and defective tires replaced prior to removal from storage.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Guidance for Rotation of Tires</span>
</p>
<p>To make sure tires are rotated through a minimum of 180 degrees, apply a chalk mark on a front wheel tire wall at the current centre contact point with the road surface. Move the car forwards until the chalk mark is at the horizontal position. This process can be applied to a single car or to a row of vehicles and should ensure that all four wheels on each vehicle is rotated by 180 degrees.</p>
<h2>PARKING BRAKE</h2>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Vehicles with Electric Park Brake (EPB)</span>

For all markets the CAT2 and CAT3 MUST be removed after 1 year . UNLESS THE VEHICLE IS TO BE TRANSPORTED BY ROAD ON A TRANSPORTER THEN REMOVE CAT2 CAT3 AFTER 180 DAYS.</p>
<p>If storage is subsequently continued, the vehicle must be kept under cover and should be washed regularly (at least every month).</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">REMOVAL FROM STORAGE</div>
</div>
<h2>PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>Before removal from storage area, all fluid levels including coolant, hydraulic fluids and lubricating oils must be checked and replenished where necessary. Where a substantial loss has occurred the cause must be traced prior to moving the vehicle.</p>
<p>The New Vehicle Storage History Sheet must be checked and safety related faults rectified before the vehicle is moved from the storage site. These checks are essential to ensure that the vehicle is safe to drive.</p>
<p>Tires must be adjusted to the pressures recommended in the relevant service manual or owners handbook.</p>
<p>Reconnect the battery negative terminal (when applicable).</p>
