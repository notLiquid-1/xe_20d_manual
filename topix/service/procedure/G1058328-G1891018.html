</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) concerns have become more important as vehicles have become more sensitive to these vibrations. This section is designed as an aid to identifying these situations</li>
<li>The section provides diagnostic procedures based on symptoms. If the condition occurs at high speed, for instance, the most likely place to start is under High Speed Shake</li>
<li>The road test procedure will tell how to sort the conditions into categories and how to tell a vibration from a shake</li>
<li>A series of Road Test Quick Checks is provided to make sure that a cause is either pinpointed or eliminated</li>
<li>Name the condition, proceed to the appropriate section and locate the correct diagnosis. When the condition is identified, the job is partly done</li>
<li>Follow the diagnostic procedure as outlined</li>
<li>Quick Checks are described within the step, while more involved tests and adjustments are outlined in General Procedures</li>
<li>Always follow each step exactly and make notes to recall important findings later</li>
</ul>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Customer Interview</div>
</div>
<p>The road test and customer interview (if available) provide information that will help identify the concerns and will provide direction to the correct starting point for diagnosis.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Identify the Condition</div>
</div>
<p>NVH problems usually occur in a number of areas:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>tires</li>
<li>engine accessories</li>
<li>suspension</li>
<li>driveline</li>
<li>air leakage (wind noise)</li>
<li>squeaks and rattles</li>
<li>heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)</li>
<li>electrical (e.g. motor noise)</li>
<li>transmission</li>
<li>engine</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important, therefore, that an NVH concern be isolated into its specific area(s) as soon as possible. The easiest and quickest way to do this is to carry out the Road Test as outlined.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Noise Diagnostic Procedure</div>
</div>
<h2>Non-Axle Noise</h2>
<p>The five most important sources of non-axle noise are exhaust, tires, roof racks, trim and mouldings, and transmission.</p>
<p>Therefore, make sure that none of the following conditions are the cause of the noise before proceeding with a driveline tear down and diagnosis.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Under certain conditions, the pitch of the exhaust may sound very much like gear noise. At other times, it can be mistaken for a wheel bearing rumble</li>
<li>Tires, especially snow tires, can have a high pitched tread whine or roar, similar to gear noise. Radial tires, to some degree, have this characteristic. Also, any non-standard tire with an unusual tread construction may emit a roar or whine type noise</li>
<li>Trim and mouldings can also cause whistling or a whining noise</li>
<li>Clunk may be a metallic noise heard when the automatic transmission is engaged in reverse or drive, or it may occur when the throttle is applied or released. It is caused by backlash somewhere in the driveline</li>
<li>Bearing rumble sounds like marbles being tumbled. This condition is usually caused by a damaged wheel bearing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Noise Conditions</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Gear noise is typically a howling or whining due to gear damage or incorrect bearing preload. It can occur at various speeds and driving conditions, or it can be continuous</li>
<li>Chuckle is a particular rattling noise that sounds like a stick against the spokes of a spinning bicycle wheel. It occurs while decelerating from approximately 64 km/h (40 miles/h) and can usually be heard all the way to a stop. The frequency varies with vehicle speed</li>
<li>Knock is very similar to chuckle, though it may be louder and occurs on acceleration or deceleration. The tear down will disclose what has to be corrected</li>
</ul>
<p>Check and rule out tires, exhaust and trim items before disassembling the transmission to diagnose and correct gear noise.</p>
<p>The noises described under Road Test usually have specific causes that can be diagnosed by observation as the unit is disassembled. The initial clues are the type of noise heard on the road test and the driving conditions.</p>
<h2>Vibration Conditions</h2>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>New Constant Velocity (CV) joints should not be installed unless disassembly and inspection revealed unusual wear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Clicking, popping or grinding noises may be caused by the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Cut or damaged CV joint boots resulting in inadequate or contaminated lubricant in the outboard or inboard CV joint bearing housings</li>
<li>Loose CV joint boot clamps</li>
<li>Another component contacting the rear drive half shaft</li>
<li>Worn, damaged or incorrectly installed wheel bearing, suspension or brake component</li>
</ul>
<p>Vibration at highway speeds may be caused by the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Out-of-balance front or rear wheels</li>
<li>Out-of-round tires</li>
<li>Driveline imbalance</li>
<li>Driveline run-out (alignment)</li>
</ul>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Rear drive half shafts are not balanced and are not likely to contribute to rotational vibration disturbance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Shudder or vibration during acceleration (including from rest) may be caused by the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Driveline alignment</li>
<li>Excessively worn or damaged outboard or inboard CV joint bearing housing</li>
<li>Excessively high CV joint operating angles caused by incorrect ride height. Check ride height, verify correct spring rate and check items under Inoperative Conditions</li>
<li>Excessively worn driveshaft components</li>

<div class="grey-heading">Road Test</div>
</div>
<p>A gear-driven unit will produce a certain amount of noise. Some noise is acceptable and may be audible at certain speeds or under various driving conditions as on a newly paved blacktop road. The slight noise is in no way detrimental and must be considered normal.</p>
<p>The road test and customer interview (if available) provide information needed to identify the condition and give direction to the correct starting point for diagnosis.</p>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="1" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 0;">
<li>Make notes throughout the diagnosis routine. Make sure to write down even the smallest piece of information, because it may turn out to be the most important.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="2" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 1;">
<li>Do not touch anything until a road test and a thorough visual inspection of the vehicle have been carried out. Leave the tire pressures and vehicle load just where they were when the condition was first observed. Adjusting tire pressures, vehicle load or making other adjustments may reduce the conditions intensity to a point where it cannot be identified clearly. It may also inject something new into the system, preventing correct diagnosis.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="3" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 2;">
<li>Make a visual inspection as part of the preliminary diagnosis routine, writing down anything that does not look right. Note tire pressures, but do not adjust them yet. Note leaking fluids, loose nuts and bolts, or bright spots where components may be rubbing against each other. Check the luggage compartment for unusual loads.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="4" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 3;">
<li>Road test the vehicle and define the condition by reproducing it several times during the road test.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="5" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 4;">
<li>Carry out the Road Test Quick Checks as soon as the condition is reproduced. This will identify the correct diagnostic procedure. Carry out the Road Test Quick Checks more than once to verify they are providing a valid result. Remember, the Road Test Quick Checks may not tell where the concern is, but they will tell where it is not.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Road Test Quick Checks</div>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="1" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 0;">
<li>24-80 km/h (15-50 miles/h): With light acceleration, a moaning noise is heard and possibly a vibration is felt in the front floor pan. It is usually worse at a particular engine speed and at a particular throttle setting during acceleration at that speed. It may also produce a moaning sound, depending on what component is causing it. Refer to Tip-In Moan in the Symptom Chart.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="2" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 1;">
<li>Acceleration/deceleration: With slow acceleration and deceleration, a shake is sometimes noticed in the steering wheel/column, seats, front floor pan, front door trim panel or front end sheet metal. It is a low frequency vibration (around 9-15 cycles per second). It may or may not be increased by applying brakes lightly. Refer to Idle Boom/Shake/Vibration in the Symptom Chart.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="3" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 2;">
<li>High speed: A vibration is felt in the front floor pan or seats with no visible shake, but with an accompanying sound or rumble, buzz, hum, drone or booming noise. Coast with the clutch pedal depressed or shift control selector lever in neutral and engine idling. If vibration is still evident, it may be related to wheels, tires, front brake discs, wheel hubs or front wheel bearings. Refer to High Speed Shake in the Symptom Chart.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="4" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 3;">
<li>Engine rpm sensitive: A vibration is felt whenever the engine reaches a particular rpm. It will disappear in neutral coasts. The vibration can be duplicated by operating the engine at the problem rpm while the vehicle is stationary. It can be caused by any component, from the accessory drive belt to the torque converter which turns at engine speed when the vehicle is stopped. Refer to High Speed Shake in the Symptom Chart.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="5" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 4;">
<li>Noise/vibration while turning: Clicking, popping, or grinding noises may be due to a worn, damaged, or incorrectly installed front wheel bearing, rear drive half shaft or CV joint.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="6" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 5;">
<li>Noise/vibration that is road speed relative: This noise/vibration can be diagnosed independent of engine speed or gear selected (engine speed varies but torque and road speed remain constant). The cause may be a rear drive axle/differential whine.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Road Conditions</div>
</div>
<p>An experienced technician will always establish a route that will be used for all NVH diagnosis road tests. The road selected should be reasonably smooth, level and free of undulations (unless a particular condition needs to be identified). A smooth asphalt road that allows driving over a range of speeds is best. Gravel or bumpy roads are unsuitable because of the additional road noise produced. Once the route is established and consistently used, the road noise variable is eliminated from the test results.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Some concerns may be apparent only on smooth asphalt roads.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If a customer complains of a noise or vibration on a particular road and only on a particular road, the source of the concern may be the road surface. If possible, try to test the vehicle on the same type of road.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Vehicle Preparation</div>
</div>
<p>Carry out a thorough visual inspection of the vehicle before carrying out the road test. Note anything which is unusual. Do not repair or adjust any condition until the road test is carried out, unless the vehicle is inoperative or the condition could pose a hazard to the technician.</p>
<p>After verifying the condition has been corrected, make sure all components removed have been installed.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">Lift Test</div>
</div>
<p>After a road test, it is sometimes useful to do a similar test on a lift.</p>
<p>When carrying out the high-speed shake diagnosis or engine accessory vibration diagnosis on a lift, observe the following precautions:</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="warning-alert">WARNING:</div>
<div class="warning-box">
<p>If only one drive wheel is allowed to rotate, speed must be limited to 55 km/h (35 miles/h) indicated on the speedometer since actual wheel speed will be twice that indicated on the speedometer. Speed exceeding 55 km/h (35 miles/h) or allowing the drive wheel to hang unsupported could result in tire disintegration, differential failure, constant velocity joint and drive half shaft failure, which could cause serious personal injury and extensive vehicle damage. Failure to follow these instructions may result in personal injury.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="caution-alert">CAUTION:</div>
<div class="caution-box">
<p>The suspension should not be allowed to hang free. When the CV joint is run at a very high angle, extra vibration as well as damage to the seals and joints can occur.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The rear suspension lower arm should be supported as far outboard as possible. To bring the vehicle to its correct ride height, the full weight of the vehicle should be supported in the rear by floor jacks. REFER to: (100-02 Jacking and Lifting)<div style="margin-left:30">Jacking (Description and Operation),</div>
<div style="margin-left:30">Lifting (Description and Operation).</div>
</p>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="1" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 0;">
<li>Raise and support the vehicle. REFER to: (100-02 Jacking and Lifting)<div style="margin-left:30">Jacking (Description and Operation),</div>
<div style="margin-left:30">Lifting (Description and Operation).</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="2" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 1;">
<li>Explore the speed range of interest using the Road Test Quick Checks as previously described.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-items">
<ol start="3" style="counter-reset: li 0; counter-increment:li 2;">
<li>Carry out a coast down in neutral. If the vehicle is free of vibration when operating at a steady indicated speed and behaves very differently in drive and coast, a transmission concern is likely.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Note, however, that a test on the lift may produce different vibrations and noises than a road test because of the effect of the lift. It is not unusual to find vibrations on the lift that were not found in the road test. If the condition found on the road can be duplicated on the lift, carrying out experiments on the lift may save a great deal of time.</p>
