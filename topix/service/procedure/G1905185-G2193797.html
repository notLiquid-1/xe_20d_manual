<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<h2></h2>
<p>The voice control system provides the driver with the option of voice control for a range of supported functions.</p>
<p>The following systems can be controlled by voice control:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Bluetooth&reg; telephone system</li>
<li>Navigation system</li>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Media devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The voice control system adopts a concept known as 'Say What You See'</p>
<p>The voice control system allows the vehicle user to concentrate fully on driving the vehicle. There is no need to divert their eyes from the road ahead in order to check information read outs on the Touchscreen (TS). The voice control system also feeds back audible information to the vehicle user.</p>
<p>Voice control is mainly a software based system. The software is resident in the Audio Head Unit (AHU), the Secure Digital (SD) memory card and the Touchscreen (TS).</p>
<p>The main software for controlling the voice control system is located on the SD memory card located in the portable audio interface panel. The SD memory card also contains software for the navigation system and the cellular phone system.</p>
<p>A voice control microphone is located in the front overhead console.</p>
<p>On vehicles without Emergency call (eCall), the microphone is connected directly to the AHU.</p>
<p>On vehicles with eCall, the microphone is connected to the AHU via the Telematics Control Module (TCU).</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">DESCRIPTION</div>
</div>
<h2>Audio Head Unit </h2>
<p>The Audio Head Unit (AHU) is located in the center of the instrument panel, below the Touchscreen (TS).</p>
<p>The voice control and navigation features are available with Level C AHU only. Level B AHU does not support voice control or navigation. </p>
<p>For additional information, refer to: <a href="./G1905182-G2193794.html" data-uid="G2193794" data-proc-uid="G1905182" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Audio System</a> (415-01B Information and Entertainment System - Vehicles With: InControl Touch, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>The AHU contains the following software:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Recognizer - Dialogue parts of the voice engine used to determine what the user wants to control by voice.</li>
<li>Text-to-Speech used to synthesize text.</li>
<li>Voice control software.</li>
<li>Voice language models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional voice control software and language models, for voice recognition and Text-to-Speech is located on the Secure Digital (SD) memory card installed in the portable media interface panel.</p>
<p>The Audio Amplifier Module (AAM) sends the audio signals to the vehicle speakers.</p>
<h2>Portable Audio Interface Panel </h2>
<a name="illus2"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E204740\en_US\large_img.jpg"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E204740" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E204740\en_US\_img.jpg"></div>
</div>
<p>Voice control software is stored on the Secure Digital (SD) memory card in addition to the software contained within the Audio Head Unit (AHU). Navigation and telephone system software is also stored on the Secure Digital (SD) memory card.</p>
<p> Vehicles with a Level C AHU have a portable audio interface panel which includes an SD memory card slot for navigation system, voice control and telephone software. </p>
<p>For additional information, refer to: <a href="./G1905186-G2193798.html" data-uid="G2193798" data-proc-uid="G1905186" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Navigation System</a> (415-01B Information and Entertainment System - Vehicles With: InControl Touch, Description and Operation).</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>The SD memory card must not be removed or the files modified. If the card is removed, the navigation, voice control and telephone will be inoperable. The SD memory card slot cannot be used for media files. Installation of any external content or modification of the files on the SD memory card can corrupt the SD memory card and cause voice control, telephone and navigation systems to be inoperable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Do not remove the SD memory card when the ignition is switched ON (Power Mode 6) or the engine is running (Power Mode 7). Removal will cause voice control, telephone and navigation systems to be inoperable. A message will appear in the Touchscreen (TS) prompting the user to insert the SD memory card. This will initialise a soft reset of the system and restore full functionality of voice control, telephone and navigation systems.</p>
<h2>Touchscreen </h2>
<p>The Touchscreen (TS) is located in the center of the instrument panel.</p>
<p>The TS provides information to a visual prompter image in the TS which determines what is displayed during a dialogue with the voice system.</p>
<p>The driver can start voice functions by briefly pressing the voice switch on the left steering wheel switchpack. The Audio Head Unit (AHU) will then initiate a voice session in the TS. This allowing the user to say voice commands to activate some of the infotainment system features.</p>
<h2>Microphone</h2>
<p>The directional type microphone is fitted to the driver side of the front overhead console so that it is directed towards the driver.</p>
<p>On vehicles with Emergency call (eCall), the microphone is connected to the Audio Head Unit (AHU) via the Telematics Control Module (TCU) for:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Hands free telephony</li>
<li>Voice control systems</li>
<li>Talk to the telematics service provider during Breakdown (bCall) or Emergency (eCall) calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>On vehicles without eCall, the microphone is connected directly to the AHU.</p>
<p>The AHU has an integrated noise suppression and echo cancellation system for hands-free telephone use.</p>
<h2>Voice Control Switch - </h2>
<p>The push-to-talk switch for the voice control system is located on the left steering wheel switchpack. </p>
<p>For additional information, refer to: <a href="./G2295013-G2295004.html" data-uid="G2295004" data-proc-uid="G2295013" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Mobile Phone</a> (415-01B Information and Entertainment System - Vehicles With: InControl Touch, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>The driver is able to use the voice control switch for:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Starting a voice session</li>
<li>Cancelling/Ending a voice session</li>
<li>'Barging in' (Interrupting) during a voice session - Stops playing the current feedback and moves directly to the next listening tone. This allowing the user to immediately enter the next command rather than having to wait.</li>
</ul>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<p>The voice control system provides the driver with the option of voice control for a range of supported functions.</p>
<p>The following systems can be controlled by voice control:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Bluetooth&reg; telephone system</li>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Media devices</li>
<li>Navigation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The voice control system uses a 'visual prompter' system, shown in the Touchscreen (TS). The visual prompter system guides the user through the flow. For example, showing examples of what they can say next and also confirmation of where they are in the conversation flow.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Telephone voice commands are only accessible when a Bluetooth&reg; device is paired and connected to the vehicle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The system is operated by the voice control switch on the left steering wheel switchpack. Voice commands are detected by the dedicated microphone in the front overhead console. When giving a voice command an audible feedback will be heard through the vehicle speakers.</p>
<p>Efficient operation of voice control is reliant on the user understanding some of the following basic operating conditions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Face forwards, sitting in a normal driving position.</li>
<li>After operating the voice button, always wait for the end of the audible tone before speaking.</li>
<li>Speak naturally, as if you were talking to a passenger or using a mobile phone without pausing between words.</li>
<li>When the system asks for more information, always wait for the end of the tone before responding.</li>
<li>Always say numbers clearly but at a natural pace.</li>
<li>Excessive noise, for example while driving with windows open, may cause voice command mis-recognition. If it is too noisy to use the phone, it is likely that voice commands will not be recognized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most accents are understood without difficulty, but if the system does not recognize the command it will allow 2 more attempts to say the command.</p>
<p>Voice feedback is given in the same language as the command recognition.</p>
<p>All feature items listed that can be activated by voice control, can also be activated by touching the relevant command list item on the TS. A list of the available features can be displayed by saying the 'More Commands' voice command. Alternatively, saying 'All Commands' or selecting 'All Commands' via the TS, will enable visual and audible instructions to be given in a default sequential order. This starts with navigation commands and then followed by other available features. The voice control system will work with the user to display the feature lists individually. Say (or select) 'Navigation Commands' or 'Phone Commands', then only the relevant commands for that feature will be read out and displayed.</p>
<h2>Starting a Voice Session</h2>
<p>To start a voice session the driver operates the voice control switch on the left steering wheel switchpack briefly. An audible tone can be heard, followed by the presentation of the 'Say What You See' visual command list in the Touchscreen (TS) indicating some commonly used available commands. A voice symbol indicates that the system is listening. Always wait for the listening tone to finish playing before using the command. To end a session press and hold the voice control switch until a double beep is heard.</p>
<p>When the voice control switch is operated on the left steering wheel switchpack, depending on system specification, a signal is received by the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The Audio Head Unit (AHU) </li>
</ul>
<p>The signal is transmitted on a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus through the Steering Wheel Module (SWM). A voltage is sent on a single wire from the switchpack, through a resistive ladder and converted to a LIN bus signal.</p>
<p> The whole process is then initiated between the AHU and the TS via the Automotive Pixel Link 2 (APIX2) connection. For example the TS starts the voice session and performs the resulting action requested by the user, but the AHU maintains the dialogue with the user. The 'Say What You See' visual prompter is calculated and presented in the TS when requested to do so by the AHU. The accompanying voice feedback is sent to the Audio Amplifier Module (AAM) for broadcast over the speakers from the AHU. If a recognized user instruction is received via the microphone, this is then processed and sent to the TS to perform the required action.</p>
<p>The voice system has speaker adaption that continuously adapts to the person speaking. When a new user speaks, the first 4 to 5 recognitions may be inaccurate as the system is adapting to the new user's voice.</p>
<h2>Navigation Destination Entry by Voice </h2>
<p>Destination entry uses phonetic transcriptions of the navigation data, stored as part of the map data. This offers to the user the ability to enter an address or postcode into the navigation system by voice. </p>
<p>The user simply follows the visual and audible instructions given by the voice system and enters their desired address in a step-by-step manner or single destination entry. For example, House number, then Street, then Town.</p>
<p>At each address entry stage, the user's voice command is matched against the phonetic map data and a list of likely recognition candidates is presented in a 'pick list' for the user to select from. If the chosen address has more than 1 location associated with it, the voice system will work with the user to determine the exact address they wish to navigate to.</p>
<h2>Dialling from the Grapheme-to-Phoneme Phonebook</h2>
<p>Provided the phonebook has been downloaded via Bluetooth&reg;, the voice system is able to perform a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) transcription of each of the names stored in the phonebook. This is then used by the voice system to allow the user to dial a contact by saying the name stored in the phonebook. There is no need to store a voice tag first.</p>
<p>The user's voice command is matched against the phonebook entries. A list of likely recognition candidates is presented in a 'pick list' for the user to select from. If the chosen contact has more than 1 number associated with it, the voice system will work with the user to determine the exact number they wish to dial.</p>
<p>The system will attempt to recognise names based on the currently selected voice language. Foreign contacts may not be recognised correctly and depending on the characters used, may not be recognised at all.</p>
<h2>Tuning to Radio Stations</h2>
<p>Depending on the region, the user can speak commands to tune to frequency or Frequency Modulation (FM) station names.</p>
<p>In European regions only, 'Tune to Station Name' is available which matches the user's spoken station name with the stored pre-set names and also stations available within range of the vehicle. For example the user can say 'Station &lt;Radio 1&gt;'.</p>
<p>In North American and Rest of the World (ROW) regions the user can tune to a valid frequency for that region. For example the user can say 'Tune to 94.5'.</p>
<h2>Playing and Browsing Music from the Connected Media devices</h2>
<p>There are also voice commands to 'Play and Browse' music from the Universal Serial Bus (USB) and iPod&reg; devices connected to the system.</p>
<p>The user can also give single commands to be able to play individual songs or albums from specific artist.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>'Play &lt;Artist Name&gt; &lt;Album Name&gt;'</li>
<li>'Play &lt;Artist name&gt; &lt; Song Name&gt;'.</li>
</ul>
<p>All commands can be spoken irrespective of the current system audio/video mode. The voice system will change modes and audio sources relevant to the command, only if the request is possible. For example, when in 'Tuner' mode, if the user requests to play a song from USB, the system will check that a portable device is connected to the USB port. If a valid device is found, the mode will change to USB and start playing the requested song.</p>
