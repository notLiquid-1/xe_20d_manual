</div>
<p>Telematics is a system of devices and features which communicates with other devices or with human users over several communications networks including vehicle networks and cellular networks Global System for Mobile communications (GSM).</p>
<p>The telematics system is integrated into the vehicle powertrain and body MultiCAN systems and communicates with the vehicle infotainment system. The system is controlled by a Telematics Control Module (TCU).</p>
<p>Telematics is a combination of built-in mobile connectivity, global satellite location information and vehicle status and control. The system provides:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Emergency Call Support (eCall)</li>
<li>Breakdown Call (bCall)</li>
<li>Stolen Vehicle Tracking/Recovery</li>
<li>Mobile Phone Applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The telematics system also features an in-vehicle WiFi hotspot using access to a 3G cellular network. The system enables the customer to access an internet connected WiFi service via the TCU and a 3G WiFi module which contains the users Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card.</p>
<p>The WiFi hotspot provides the following features:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In-vehicle internet connection for WiFi enabled devices</li>
<li>A Local Area Network (LAN) for more than one device, for example, for gaming</li>
<li>The internet connection is provided by the TCU, using a customer provided SIM card located in the SIM card reader in portable media interface panel.</li>

<p>The Telematics Control Module (TCU) is located below the steering column, behind the instrument panel lower trim panel. The TCU is attached to a bracket which in turn is attached the instrument panel cross-car beam.</p>
<p>The TCU controls the Telematics system, communicating with the vehicle systems over High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus and the Medium Speed (MS) CAN body systems bus. The system transmits/receives signals via Radio Frequency (RF), Global Positioning System (GPS) and GSM.</p>
<p>The TCU has an integral embedded Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card. The embedded SIM card is part of the module circuitry and cannot be removed. The embedded SIM card is configured to enable the network to retrieve and pass information to the Telematics Service Provider (TSP), this enables the TSP to call back the TCU. During an eCall and bCall, the embedded SIM card will be used, overriding the SIM card in the 3G WiFi module. This will result in loss of WiFi during the call and call back.</p>
<p>A back-up battery pack, consisting of two battery cells, is integrated into the TCU. The battery pack enables continued operation in the event of a vehicle main power source dis-connection: for example in a major accident or in the case of deliberate action of a thief as part of a vehicle theft attempt. This feature enables the eCall and vehicle tracking functions to carry on operating in the above mentioned circumstances.</p>
<p class="pf-title">Telematics Control Module Battery Pack</p>
<a name="illus3"></a>
<div class="zoom-image-wrapper">
<div class="image-box">
<a class="zoom-button popup-with-zoom-anim" href="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E160290\en_US\large_img.jpg"><i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i></a><img class="example-image" alt="E160290" src="..\..\..\topix\service\graphic\ODYSSEY\E160290\en_US\img.jpg"></div>
</div>
<p>The battery pack is located in the Telematics Control Module (TCU), under a cover which is retained by a screw.</p>
<p>The battery pack contains one re-chargeable cell and one non-rechargeable cell. The two battery cells are controlled separately by the TCU software.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>The two battery cells cannot be replaced as separate items. The battery pack is replaced as a complete unit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The use of two different battery cells provides continued performance at very low temperatures. The re-chargeable cell cannot deliver the charge effectively at very low temperatures. The non-rechargeable cell has improved performance at low temperatures.</p>
<p>The back-up battery will only be active during an eCall, bCall or stolen vehicle tracking session in which the vehicle power supply is disabled. Once the non-rechargeable cell has been used it will require replacement to restore the full capability of the eCall and stolen vehicle tracking systems.</p>
<p>TCU battery back-up power is also required for the Jaguar logistics tracking system when the vehicle is in transit mode.</p>
<p>Transit mode removes power to the TCU approximately 15 seconds after the ignition is switched OFF (Power Mode 0). The ignition off mode may occur before the TCU has sent all of its logistics tracking data to the manufacturer servers.</p>
<p>The backup battery enables the TCU to reliably deliver this data. The TCU is programmed not to use the non-rechargeable cell for this purpose.</p>
<p>The TCU is in a pre-activated state when in transit mode. The non-rechargeable battery function is not activated as it would become depleted during transportation to the dealer and would immediately require a service replacement before handing the vehicle over to the customer. For this reason only the re-chargeable cell is used in these circumstances.</p>
<p>During the vehicle PDI (pre-delivery inspection) process the TCU is removed from transit mode and switched on to an 'activated state' where both battery cells become active. During a TCU main power source dis-connection the re-chargeable battery cell will always be used first. The non-rechargeable cell is only used if eCall or stolen vehicle tracking are activated.</p>
<p>The expected battery pack life is approximately 10 years if not used frequently. The warranty period of the battery pack may differ between markets.</p>
<p>The TCU charges the re-chargeable cell when the engine is running (Power Mode 7). The charging function is controlled and regulated by the TCU software.</p>
<p>If either battery cell becomes depleted below a preset threshold or fails completely the following warnings/actions are displayed in the message center:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>"SOS System Limited"</li>
<li>"SOS System Not Available"</li>
</ul>
<p>A signal is sent to the TSP and a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is set in the TCU.</p>
<p>When the back-up battery has been replaced, the system must be re-set using a specific application on a Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) approved diagnostic system, setting the battery level back to 100%.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">SOS System Limited</p>
<p>This message is driven by DTCs, relating to hardware issues:</p>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>External GSM/UMTS antenna connection failure</li>
<li>External GNSS antenna connection failure</li>
<li>eCall switch connection failure</li>
<li>Hard wired connection failure with RCM</li>
<li>Microphone connection failure</li>
<li>GNSS receiver failure, Internal RTC failure</li>
<li>Speaker connection failure</li>
<li>TCU Backup Battery Depleted</li>
</ul>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">SOS System Not Available</p>
<p>This message is driven by four possible scenarios:</p>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The TCU is disconnected or unresponsive</li>
<li>Failed Emergency Call due to no Cellular Network coverage</li>
<li>Failed Emergency Call due to no eCall Number provisioned</li>
<li>Modem Failure</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Service Mode</span>
</p>
<p>Before disconnecting power to the Telematics Control Module (TCU), for example disconnecting the primary vehicle battery to do maintenance repairs, the vehicle owner must place the TCU into 'Service Mode'.</p>
<p>If the disconnection procedure is not carried out, the system will activate the InControl Secure application and will enter 'Theft Notification' or 'Stolen Vehicle Tracking' mode during which time the charge in the back-up battery would be used. If the non-rechargeable back-up cell becomes depleted through this action, it may reach the point where it requires replacing.</p>
<p>For security purposes 'Service Mode' is the sole responsibility of the vehicle owner.</p>
<p>During vehicle maintenance, where the primary vehicle battery is disconnected for a period of time exceeding the 10 hour window, the vehicle owner must either be informed by the dealer to re-activate Service Mode (using their mobile phone app) or the owner must inform the 'Stolen Vehicle Tracking' service provider that the vehicle is currently in the dealership for repairs with the vehicle battery disconnected, instructing the service provider to ignore the Stolen Vehicle Tracking notifications during the repair period.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">Transport Mode</span>
</p>
<p>The Telematics Control Module (TCU) contains a motion sensor which is used for vehicle movement detection as part of the stolen vehicle tracking system. Prior to transporting the vehicle, for example a ferry journey, the vehicle owner must place the TCU into 'Transport Mode' to disable the motion sensor.</p>
<p>If the motion sensor is not disabled and the ignition is switched OFF (Power Mode 0), but vehicle movement is detected, the 'Theft Notification' function will be activated. As with Service Mode, Transport Mode is the sole responsibility of the vehicle owner for security reasons.</p>
<p>The motion sensor is capable of detecting slow movement, e.g. jacking the vehicle to remove a road wheel, or winching onto a transporter.</p>
<p>Triggering of the sensor does not immediately generate a 'Theft Notification', but it will activate the GPS receiver and measure the vehicle's movement. If the vehicle moves more than a predefined distance (approximately 200 meters) the TCU sends a theft alert to the service provider.</p>
<p>The service provider contacts the vehicle owner to determine if a genuine theft has taken place. If a vehicle theft is confirmed the service provider initiates full GPS tracking of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Transport Mode disables the movement assessment by the GPS that follows a motion detection, therefore no 'Theft Notification' will be sent to the service provider. Should transporting the vehicle exceed the 10 hour window it is the responsibility of the vehicle owner to reset Transport Mode to avoid a false theft notification being generated.</p>

</div>
<p>When the vehicle has the ignition OFF (Power Mode 0) and the MultiCAN buses are 'asleep', the TCU is still active, enabling movement detection should an illegal attempt be made to move the vehicle. The TCU has a permanent battery feed to enable this function. The drain on the vehicle primary battery is minimal and the vehicle remains well within its quiescent drain target.</p>
<p>The TCU is linked to the engine immobilization circuit. When a start request is made the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) requests the TCU to pass a secure identification over the MultiCAN bus. If the identification matches the one in the BCM/GWM, the start request is authorised.</p>
<p>In the event of disconnection or damage to the roof pod or the telematics antenna, resulting in the loss of the GSM signal, an internal antenna, integrated into the TCU, is used as a back-up GSM antenna. The backup GSM antenna is used to re-establish communication with the emergency service provider or TSP.</p>

<p>The front overhead console houses the Breakdown call (bCall) and Emergency call (eCall) switches, microphone and Telematics speaker. The functions of the bCall and eCall switches are controlled by the Telematics Control Module (TCU). </p>
<p>A diagnostic line (BTN), between the front overhead console and the TCU, enables the system to check the harness wiring is connected and the interface is functioning correctly. In operation, the TCU briefly pulls the diagnostic line (BTN) to ground, allowing the TCU to detect the circuit completion.</p>
<p>The microphone input is shared by the TCU and Audio Head Unit (AHU) for voice control. The location of the microphone changes depending on the vehicle market specification. The TCU controls the output to the telematics speaker.</p>
<p>Light Emitting Diode (LED) indicators, integrated into the eCall and bCall switches, provide switch illumination and indicate the status of the call operation.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the LED indicator status for the eCall and bCall switches during normal use.</p>

<p>The Telematics Control Module (TCU) receives the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Signal reception is via roof pod which contains the GPS and GSM antennas.</p>
<p>The GPS signal is received by the antenna and is passed to the GPS signal splitter. The GPS output from the GPS signal splitter is sent to the TCU for telematics system use and to the Audio Head Unit (AHU) for navigation use.</p>
<p>The GSM signal is received by the roof pod. The signal is passed by a co-axial cable directly to the TCU. In the event of a malfunction of the roof pod, the backup GSM antenna within the TCU will also receive the GSM signal. </p>
<p>The GSM signal provided by Vodafone enables the TCU to communicate with the Telematics Service Provider (TSP) Wireless Car. The TSP provides secure mobile data connection and co-ordinates the sending and receiving of vehicle data and control commands. Telematics provides two main services, vehicle and driver.</p>
<p>The Jaguar InControl system includes vehicle services, Breakdown call (bCall), Emergency call (eCall) and stolen vehicle tracking. Driver services include mobile phone applications with remote vehicle functions.</p>
<p>Several third party suppliers are integral to the InControl system. In each market emergency response agencies are integrated with InControl along with Jaguar Assistance and Stolen Vehicle Tracking.</p>
<p>A dedicated mobile phone application and the InControl owner website are available to provide an intuitive and secure interface for InControl&trade; users. An administration website is available for dealerships to set up and manage customer accounts.</p>
<p>The TCU receives the following inputs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Hardwired and CAN crash signal from the Restraints Control Module (RCM) - automatic eCall activation.</li>
<li>eCall/bCall switch activation signals</li>
<li>Microphone signal</li>
<li>Roof pod or telematics antenna GSM and GPS signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TCU provides the following outputs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Telematics speaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication with the vehicle systems is via the MultiCAN buses, enabling remote vehicle feature functions. The following TCU primary communications transmit data on the following MultiCAN buses:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Engine immobilisation start request ID - TCU to Central Junction Box - High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus</li>
<li>RCM crash signal status/verification - TCU to RCM - HS CAN powertrain systems bus</li>
<li>Jaguar InControl data - TCU - Medium Speed (MS) CAN body systems bus through the Gateway Module - MS CAN body systems bus to the Instrument Cluster (IC) and Touchscreen (TS).</li>
</ul>
