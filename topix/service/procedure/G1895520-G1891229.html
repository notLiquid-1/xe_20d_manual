<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p>A continuously variable damping system, known as adaptive damping is available on some vehicle models. Adaptive damping is an electronically controlled suspension system that continuously adjusts the damping characteristics of the suspension shock absorbers in reaction to the existing driving conditions.</p>
<p>The system is controlled by a Suspension Control Module (SUM). The SUM receives signals from three accelerometers, four height sensors and other vehicle systems to determine:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Vehicle state</li>
<li>Body and wheel motions</li>
<li>Driver inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These signals are used by the SUM to continuously control the damping characteristics of each shock absorber to the appropriate level to provide the optimum body control and vehicle ride.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">
<div class="grey-hr"></div>
<div class="grey-heading">DESCRIPTION</div>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Shock Absorbers</p>
<p>The adaptive shock absorbers are nitrogen gas and oil filled monotube units. The shock absorbers are continuously variable, which allows the damping force to be electrically adjusted when the vehicle is being driven. The shock absorbers provide the optimum compromise between vehicle control and ride comfort.</p>
</div>
<p>The shock absorbers have an electrical connector on the end of the piston rod, in the center of the top mount.</p>
<p>In each shock absorber, the damping adjustment is achieved by a variable orifice operated by a solenoid. The orifice is used to open up alternative paths to allow oil-flow within the shock absorber. When de-energized the bypass is closed and all the oil flows through the main (firm) piston. When energized the solenoid moves an armature and control blade, which work against a spring. The control blade incorporates an orifice which slides inside a sintered housing to open up the bypass as required. When the shock absorber is compressed the oil flows from the lower portion of the shock absorber then through a hollow piston rod, which is a separate soft (comfort) valve. The oil then flows through the slider housing and orifice and into the upper portion of the shock absorber, thereby bypassing the main (firm) valve. In rebound the oil flows in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>In the firm setting oil flows through the main (firm) valve only, although when the bypass is opened by variable amounts, the oil flows through both valves to provide a pressure balance. When fully energized the solenoid moves the armature and therefore the slider to the maximum extension and opens the orifice completely. The shock absorber operates continuously between these two boundary conditions.</p>
<p>The solenoid in each shock absorber is operated by a 526 Hz Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal from the SUM. The SUM controls the PWM duty ratio to provide 1.5 A to operate the shock absorber in the soft setting. When de-energized (0.0 A) the shock absorber is in the firm setting. The current varies continuously as required to increase and decrease the damping individually in each of the shock absorbers.</p>

<p>Three accelerometers are used in the adaptive damping system; two at the front of the vehicle and one at the rear.</p>
<p>The accelerometers measure acceleration in the vertical plane and output a corresponding analogue signal to the SUM. The algorithms in the pulse width modulation calculate the heave, pitch and roll motions of the vehicle, which are used by the SUM. to control body motion.</p>
<p>Each accelerometer is connected to the SUM via three wires, which supply ground, 5 V supply and signal return.</p>
<p>The sensing element comprises a single parallel plate capacitor, one plate of which moves relative to the other dependant on the force (acceleration) applied. This causes the capacitance to change as a function of applied acceleration. This capacitance is compared with a fixed reference capacitor in a bridge circuit and the signal is processed by means of a dedicated integrated circuit to generate an output voltage that varies as a function of applied acceleration. The sensors output a signal voltage of approximately 1 V/g &plusmn; 0.05 V/g. When the vehicle is stationary, each accelerometer outputs approximately 2 volts.</p>

<p>Four height sensors are used in the adaptive damping system, two for the front suspension and two for the rear suspension. A front suspension height sensor is attached to each side of the front subframe and connected by a sensor arm and sensor link to the related lower lateral-arm of the front suspension. A rear suspension height sensor is attached to each side of the rear subframe and connected by a sensor arm and sensor link to the related upper control-arm of the rear suspension.</p>
<p>The right suspension height sensors are dual output, with separate outputs for the adaptive damping system and for the Adaptive Front Lighting (AFS) system. The left suspension height sensors are single output, for the adaptive damping system only.</p>
<p>On each suspension height sensor, the sensor arm and sensor link convert linear movement of the suspension into rotary movement of the sensor shaft. The suspension height sensors measure suspension displacement at each corner of the vehicle and output a corresponding analogue signal to the SUM. The algorithms in the SUM calculate the position, velocity and frequency content of the signals and use the results for wheel control.</p>
<p>Each suspension height sensor is connected to the SUM via three wires, which supply ground, 5 V supply and signal return.</p>
<p>The sensing element consists of Hall effect devices arranged to measure the direction of the magnetic field of a small magnet attached to the end of the sensor shaft. As the sensor shaft rotates, so do the lines of magnetic flux from the magnet. The signals from the Hall effect devices are processed by means of a dedicated integrated circuit to generate an output voltage that varies as the sensor shaft is rotated. The sensor has a measurement range of &plusmn; 40&deg; around its nominal position and the nominal sensitivity is 57 mV/&deg; of shaft rotation.</p>

<p>The SUM is installed at the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<h2>System Fault Message</h2>
<p>If a fault is detected by the SUM, a message is sent via the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) to the Instrument Cluster (IC) and the message 'ADAPTIVE DAMPING FAULT' is displayed. The SUM also logs an appropriate Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). The SUM can be interrogated using an approved diagnostic system.</p>
<p>When a fault is detected, the SUM implements a strategy based on the type of fault. If there is an electrical power fault, or the SUM cannot control the shock absorbers, they default to the firm condition. If a sensor fails that only affects one or more control modes then an intermediate damper setting is used as the lower threshold and the remaining working modes can demand higher damping as required. In the event of a HS CAN bus fault, the shock absorbers are fixed at an intermediate setting (no control) or default to the firm condition, depending on the severity of the fault.</p>
<div class="grey-heading-container">

<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<p>The SUM uses a combination of information from other system modules and data from the accelerometers and suspension height sensors to measure the vehicle and suspension states and driver inputs. Using this information, the SUM applies algorithms to control the shock absorbers for the current driving conditions.</p>
<p>The SUM receives the following signals on the HS CAN bus from the stated system components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Brake Pressure - ABS module</li>
<li>Brake Pressure Quality Factor - ABS module</li>
<li>Brake Pressure Quality Factor - ABS module</li>
<li>Centre Differential Range Actual - ECM</li>
<li>Engine Speed - ECM</li>
<li>Engine Speed Quality Factor - ECM</li>
<li> Engine Torque Flywheel Actual - ECM</li>
<li>Engine Torque Flywheel Actual Quality Factor - ECM</li>
<li>Gear Position Target - TCM</li>
<li>Lateral Acceleration - ABS module</li>
<li>Power Mode (Ignition Signal) - CJB</li>
<li>Power Mode Quality Factor - CJB</li>
<li>Roll Stability Control Mode - ABS module</li>
<li>Steering Wheel Angle - ABS module</li>
<li>Steering Wheel Angle Speed - ABS module</li>
<li>Steering Wheel Angle Status - ABS module</li>
<li>Terrain Mode Requested - TCS</li>
<li>Torque Converter Slip - TCM</li>
<li>Vehicle Speed - ABS module</li>
<li>Vehicle Speed Quality Factor - ABS module</li>
<li>Front Left Wheel Speed - ABS module</li>
<li>Front Left Wheel Speed Quality Factor - ABS module</li>
<li>Front Right Wheel Speed - ABS module</li>
<li>Front Right Wheel Speed Quality Factor - ABS module</li>
<li>Rear Left Wheel Speed - ABS module</li>
<li>Rear Left Wheel Speed Quality Factor - ABS module</li>
<li>Rear Right Wheel Speed - ABS module</li>
<li>Rear Right Wheel Speed Quality Factor - ABS module.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SUM also outputs information on the HS CAN bus for use by other systems as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li> Fault Message - IC.</li>
<li>Terrain Mode Change Status &ndash; transmission control switch.</li>
<li>Terrain Mode - transmission control switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SUM monitors the input signals and operates the shock absorber solenoids. The input signals are used in control functions and a force required for each shock absorber, for each function, is calculated. An arbitrator monitors the force requirements from each function and apportions a force to a shock absorber. The force is converted to the appropriate current and sent to the shock absorber.</p>
<p>The control functions are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Body Control - Uses CAN and accelerometer inputs. Calculates road induced body motions 100 times a second and sets each shock absorber to the appropriate level to maintain a flat and level body.</li>
<li>Roll Rate Control - Uses CAN inputs. Predicts vehicle roll rate due to driver steering inputs 100 times a second and increases damping to reduce roll rate.</li>
<li>Pitch Rate Control - Uses CAN inputs. Predicts vehicle pitch rate due to driver throttle and braking inputs 100 times a second and increases damping to reduce pitch rate.</li>
<li>Bump Rebound Control - Uses suspension height sensor inputs. Monitors the position of the wheel 500 times a second and increases the damping rate as the shock absorber approaches the end of its travel.</li>
<li>Wheel Hop Control - Uses suspension height sensor and CAN inputs. Monitors the position of the wheel 500 times a second and detects when the wheel begins to vibrate at its natural frequency and increases the damping to reduce vertical wheel motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under normal road conditions when the vehicle is stationary with the engine running, the shock absorbers are set to the firm condition to reduce power consumption.</p>
<p>The SUM receives its power supply via a relay and fuse in the CJB. The relay remains energized for a period of time after the ignition is off. This allows the SUM to record and store any DTC relating to adaptive damping system faults.</p>
<p>
<span class="bold-black">All Surface Progress Control</span>
</p>
<p>The All surface progress control offers an enhanced launch control on slippery surfaces within vehicle capabilities and maintains safe, composed progress on all applicable surfaces.</p>
<p>All surface progress control allows even an inexperienced driver to access all possible traction.</p>
<p>The system can be activated with the All surface progress control switch on the floor console and controlled via the speed control switches.</p>
