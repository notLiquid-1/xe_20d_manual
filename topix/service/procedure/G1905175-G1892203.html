<div class="grey-heading">OVERVIEW</div>
</div>
<p>There are three variants of speed control available; a standard speed control system, an adaptive speed control system and a speed limiter system.</p>
<p>The standard speed control system maintains a set speed selected by the driver until operation is suspended or cancelled by a further input from the driver and is controlled by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM).</p>
<p>The adaptive speed control system includes the same functionality as the standard system, but also has the ability to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Automatically reduce vehicle speed, to less than the set speed, in order to maintain a selected time gap behind a slower moving vehicle.</li>
<li>Automatically accelerate the vehicle back to the set speed, once the way ahead is clear, after reducing the set speed because of a slower moving vehicle.</li>
<li>Alert the driver when the vehicle comes within a given time gap of a slower moving vehicle (forward alert feature).</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASL system restricts the vehicle speed to an adjustable preset maximum, and will prevent the vehicle exceeding that speed.</p>
<h2>Speed Limiter</h2>
<p>The speed limiter is a driving aid only. This system operates in exclusivity with the adaptive or standard cruise control systems. The speed control can be alternated between the cruise control and speed limiter functions.</p>
<p>There are two types of speed limiter: Automatic Speed Limiter (ASL) and Intelligent Speed Limiter (ISL).</p>
<p>The speed limiter system is activated via the 'LIM' switch on the right steering wheel switchpack or alternatively can be selected via the Touchscreen (TS) operating menu.</p>
<p>When the speed limiter mode has been activated, selection of either the ASL or ISL can then be made by the operation of pushing and holding the 'CAN' switch on the right steering wheel switchpack.</p>
<h2>Automatic Speed Limiter </h2>
<p>The Automatic Speed Limiter (ASL) system is activated via an 'ASL' switch on the right steering wheel switchpack. The system speed is set using the speed control SET '+' and '-' switches. The selected speed is displayed in the instrument cluster. The set speed can be adjusted at any time using the speed control '+' or '-' switches. ASL can be suspended by pressing the 'CANCEL' switch. ASL can be resumed using the 'RESUME' switch, but only if the vehicle speed is at or below the ASL set speed and above 32 km/h (20 mph). If the vehicle speed is too high to resume ASL operation, a message will be displayed in the Instrument Cluster (IC).</p>
<p>The ASL system allows full driver control of the vehicle speed up to the set speed. The speed limiter will restrict the vehicle speed and will not allow the speed to go over the set limit. If kickdown is activated (by fully depressing the accelerator pedal), ASL will be temporarily overridden.</p>
<p>This system operates in exclusivity with the adaptive speed control system, only one of these systems can be active at any one time.</p>
<p>On a vehicle fitted with the ASL system, the speed control system that was in use when the ignition was turned off (ignition mode 0) is saved and activated again when the ignition is turned back on (ignition mode 6). However the speed settings are not remembered and will have to be set again.</p>
<h2>Intelligent Speed Limiter </h2>
<p>The Intelligent Speed Limiter (ISL) indicator lamp will illuminate when the ISL has been selected. The ISL restricts the vehicle's maximum speed to the current legal applicable road speed limit. The speed limit information is provided by the Navigation system and Traffic sign recognition. If a valid speed limit is not available, ISL will be deactivated and the limiter will default to ASL.</p>
<p>The ISL system will only respond to speed settings from the lowest possible, 30 km/h (19 mph) and maximum speed limit 130 km/h (80 mph). Below this speed range a message, SET POINT OUT OF RANGE will be displayed in the Message center. Any Traffic sign recognition above the maximum speed limit range, the ISL will set the speed limiter to unlimited.</p>
<p>Adjustment, to a maximum of 10 km/h (6 mph) above and below the legal speed limit, can be set operating the speed control SET '+' and '-' switches. If a legal speed limit is detected higher or lower than the current vehicle speed, the ISL will adjust the speed at a safe level. Operating the 'RES' switch will enable the vehicle to reach this limit at a faster rate.</p>
<p>If the vehicle speed exceeds the speed limit by more than 3.5 km/h (2 mph) a warning will be displayed in the message center. If the speed exceeds the speed limit by 7 km/h (5 mph) for more than 4 seconds a chime will sound.</p>
<p>Operating the 'CAN' switch will put the ISL into stand-by mode, the ISL is re-activated by operating the 'RES' switch. If kickdown is activated (by fully depressing the accelerator pedal), ISL will be overridden.</p>
<p>On a vehicle fitted with the speed limiter ASL and ISL systems, if the ASL speed limiter system was in use when the ignition was turned off (ignition mode 0), the ASL selected mode is saved and activated again when the ignition is turned back on (ignition mode 6). However the speed settings are not remembered and will have to be set again. If the ISL system was in use when the ignition was turned off (ignition mode 0), upon the ignition being turned back on (ignition mode 6) the ISL is deactivated and the speed limiter defaults to the ASL operating mode.</p>
<h2>Speed Control</h2>
<p>The standard speed control system has the following components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>SET '+' switch</li>
<li>'-' switch</li>
<li>RESUME switch</li>
<li>CANCEL switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed control system also uses:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Powertrain Control Module (PCM)</li>
<li>Right steering wheel switchpack gap increase and decrease control switches</li>
<li>Brake pedal switch</li>
<li>Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module</li>
<li>Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor</li>
<li>Clutch pedal position sensor (manual transmission only).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adaptive Speed Control </h2>
<p>The adaptive speed control system uses a forward looking radar sensor to scan the road ahead, looking for objects that are moving at a different rate to itself. When a target is identified the adaptive speed control system will monitor the time gap between the host and the target vehicles. When the time gap falls below a set driver selected level, the speed control system will intervene, slowing the vehicle by backing off the throttle and/or applying the brakes, until the correct time gap is attained. The driver can chose between four time gap settings. The chosen setting is displayed in the instrument cluster.</p>
<p>The system will detect but not react to the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Vehicles in the oncoming lane</li>
<li>Stationary vehicles</li>
<li>Pedestrians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptive speed control is active when the vehicle is moving at a minimum speed of 32 km/h (20 mph) and a maximum of 200 km/h (120 mph). Adaptive speed control only functions when a set speed is entered in the system using the SET '+' switch on the steering wheel switchpack. The adaptive speed control system only intervenes with the set speed when it detects a target vehicle, and then only if the minimum time gap is breached or is about to be breached.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the system is intended for use in limited driving situations, does not remove control and responsibility from the driver, and at all times can be quickly overridden. The adaptive speed control system is not a collision warning system and will not react to stationary objects. The system does not operate below a minimum speed of approximately 32 km/h (20 mph) since it is unsuitable for use in cities or congested traffic. The system is best suited to main roads/highways with gradual bends.</p>
<p>If the vehicle is in 'Follow Mode' and the 'Follow Mode' is turned 'off', the minimum speed for adaptive speed control will be 36 km/h (22 mph).</p>
<p>The adaptive speed control system is controlled by an Adaptive Speed Control Module (ASCM).</p>
<p>The adaptive speed control system also uses the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module.</p>

</div>
<p>The speed control switches are located on the right steering wheel switchpack. The switches are connected via fly leads to the Clockspring (CLKSPG). The speed control switches are resistive ladder type switches which vary the resistance of a 5 Volt signal supplied from the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM). The signal is returned on a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus, via the Clockspring to the BCM/GWM. The BCM/GWM sends the control signals on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus for use by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) and to the Adaptive Speed Control Module (ASCM) on vehicles with adaptive speed control.</p>
<p>The adaptive speed control switches are the same as used for standard speed control, with the addition of two time gap switches. The time gap switches allow the driver to adjust the follow mode and forward alert functions to one of four pre-set time gaps (gap 1 = 1. 0 second; gap 2 = 1.4 seconds; gap 3 = 1.8 seconds; gap 4 = 2.2 seconds). The selected time gap is displayed in the message center when the time gap switches are operated.</p>
<p>When adaptive speed control is engaged, the switches adjust the follow mode time gap. When adaptive speed control is disengaged, the switches adjust the forward alert time gap (provided forward alert is enabled in the instrument cluster menu). The follow mode function defaults to the gap 3 setting each time the ignition is switched on. The forward alert function recalls the last selected time gap when the ignition is switched on.</p>

</div>
<p>The Adaptive Speed Control Module (ASCM) is mounted on a bracket which is attached to the front bumper beam.</p>
<p>The ASCM contains a forward looking radar transceiver together with related controlling hardware and software. The High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus connection allows the ASCM to communicate with other system control modules. Power supplies to the ASCM are from the extended ignition relay in the Rear Junction Box (RJB).</p>
<p>The ASCM is active whenever the ignition is on, even if speed control is not engaged, in order to operate the forward alert, advanced emergency brake assist and intelligent emergency braking functions. With the ignition on, the ASCM is electrically powered, but no radar transmissions are emitted until the vehicle is in motion.</p>
<p>The ASCM transmits a radar beam forward of the vehicle and detects the returning signals reflected off other vehicles and objects ahead. The radar beam is electronically scanned at a rate of 20 sweeps/second across a total arc of 20&deg; centered on the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The radar operates at millimetric wavelengths (76 - 77 GHz) and transmits a frequency modulated continuous wave signal at a relatively low power level (no high power pulses). The control module detects the range, relative velocity and angle of objects within the scanned arc for up to a distance of approximately 130 meters (426.5 feet).</p>
<p>The ASCM compares vehicle speed data from the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) control module with the relative speed of an external object as detected by the radar to determine if the object is stationary or not. If tires are fitted which are different in diameter from those specified for the vehicle, the vehicle speed, calculated by the ABS control module, will not be the true road speed. This situation may cause stationary objects to be falsely identified as moving vehicles and result in automatic deceleration on a clear road.</p>
<p>The ASCM continuously monitors both moving vehicles and stationary objects to determine if it can 'see' normally. If the ASCM can detect only a few objects, because it is physically blocked (for example by an accumulation of snow or mud on the lower grill of the front bumper, or an incorrectly located licence plate), or there are few roadside objects or other vehicles in the area, it may determine that it is blocked. The ASCM then inhibits adaptive speed control and records a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). The system will reset after an ignition cycle. In this case the ASCM does not have a fault and should not be replaced.</p>
<p>If the ASCM is replaced in service it must be mechanically aligned vertically. Horizontal alignment is achieved by putting the ASCM into service mode using approved Jaguar diagnostic equipment. The vehicle then needs to be driven for a short period while the ASCM performs a calibration routine. Calibration is complete when the follow mode warning indicator in the Instrument Cluster (IC) stops flashing.

<div class="grey-heading">OPERATION</div>
</div>
<h2>Standard Speed Control</h2>
<p>The speed control system is integrated with the engine management system and uses fueling intervention to automatically maintain a set vehicle speed. Once engaged, the system can also be used to accelerate the vehicle without using the accelerator pedal. The speed control system comprises the following main components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>'+' and '-' (SET/increase speed and decrease speed) switches - located on right steering wheel switchpack</li>
<li>'RES' (resume) switch - located on right steering wheel switchpack</li>
<li>'CAN' (cancel) switch - located on right steering wheel switchpack</li>
<li>Clockspring</li>
<li>Speed control warning indicator in Instrument Cluster (IC).</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed control system also uses inputs from the brake pedal switch, clutch pedal position sensor (manual transmission only), the Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor, the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) and the Anti-lock Brake system control module.</p>
<p>The speed control is operated by the driver using only the switches on the right steering wheel switchpack. When speed control is active, the PCM regulates the output signals to the fuel injectors to adjust the fuel supply as required to maintain the set speed.</p>
<p>During speed control operation, the PCM controls vehicle speed by adjusting fuel injection duration and timing. When the accelerator pedal is pressed with speed control active, the PCM outputs a calculated throttle angle signal in place of the actual throttle angle signals produced by the APP sensor. The calculated throttle angle is derived from fuel demand based on the torque required to overcome the rolling resistance (vehicle motion drag).</p>
<p>The minimum set speed for speed control is 32 km/h (20 mph). Speed control is automatically suspended if the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Vehicle speed falls below 24 km/h (15 mph)</li>
<li>The brake pedal is pressed</li>
<li>The clutch pedal is pressed (manual transmission only)</li>
<li>The cancel button is pressed</li>
<li>Neutral, park or reverse gear is selected</li>
<li>The Electric Park Brake (EPB) is applied</li>
<li>The difference between actual speed and the set speed is too great</li>
<li>If the accelerator pedal is used to accelerate beyond the set speed for too long (more than 5 minutes)</li>
<li>Engine speed too high (cancel limit set just below red line)</li>
<li>The Anti-lock Brake system (ABS) logs a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) fault</li>
<li>System error causes shut-off</li>
<li>All Surface Progress Control (ASPC) is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four standard speed control switches located on the right steering wheel switchpack:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Set speed '+' (increase speed) switch</li>
<li>Decrease speed '-' switch</li>
<li>Cancel 'CAN' switch</li>
<li>Resume 'RES' switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard speed control switches are located on the right steering wheel switchpack. The switches are resistive ladder type switches which vary the resistance of a voltage signal sent to them. The resistive ladder is wired to a control module within the right steering wheel switchpack. The control module is a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) node, which transmits the data to the Body Control Module/Gateway Module (BCM/GWM) which passes the data onto the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus In the event of the PCM logging a speed control switch fault Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC), fault finding should start at the right steering wheel switchpack and . The PCM diagnostic detects that the right steering wheel switchpack has not provided an updated live counter.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Engage Speed Control</p>
<p>Speed control is engaged by pressing the SET '+' switch. On receipt of the switch input, the PCM adopts the current vehicle speed as the speed control set speed. When speed control is engaged, the Instrument Cluster (IC) illuminates the speed control warning indicator and the set speed is displayed in the message center. Once engaged the speed can be increased by one of 3 methods:</p>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Press and hold the SET '+' switch which will cause the vehicle to accelerate. When the switch is released the attained speed will be set as the cruise speed</li>
<li>Repeatedly pressing the SET '+' switch. Each press increases the vehicle speed by 2 km/h (1 mph)</li>
<li>Use the accelerator pedal to increase the vehicle speed. Once the required speed is reached, a single press of the SET '+' switch will set the cruise speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speed control adjustment is limited around the current vehicle speed. This means speed adjustment will not occur when the 'RES' switch is pressed or if the vehicle speed is noticeably different to set speed. This is noticeable when resuming speed control and a large difference exists between the set speed and the current speed. The driver can set a new speed, but cannot adjust the old speed.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Reduce Cruising Speed</p>
<p>The set speed can be reduced by pressing and holding the decrease speed '-' switch until the required speed is reached. When the switch is released the speed is reset at that value. The set speed can be reduced incrementally by pressing and releasing the decrease speed '-' switch. Each press will reduce the speed by 2 km/h (1 mph).</p>
</div>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Suspend Speed Control</p>
<p>Suspending speed control means speed control has been deactivated without loss of the memory speed. In all suspend events, the memory speed is retained. Speed control can be suspended in a number of ways, as described previously in this section.</p>
</div>
<p>A single press of the resume 'RES' switch will resume speed control at the previously set speed.</p>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="note-alert">NOTE:</div>
<div class="note-box">
<p>In the event that a memory speed has been lost during a driving cycle, confirm with the customer if the "Cruise Not Available" message was observed. Loss of memory speed implies a fault has occurred. The message 'Cruise Not Available' may only be displayed on demand for some errors, so speed control needs to be requested via the SET '+' switch to drive the message.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<h2>Adaptive Speed Control</h2>
<div class="wcn-container">
<div class="warning-alert">WARNING:</div>
<div class="warning-box">
<p>The adaptive speed control system is not a collision warning or avoidance system. At all times the driver must be prepared to intervene to control the vehicle speed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Adaptive speed control operation is similar to the standard speed control system for engaging, suspending and resuming speed control. The main differences between the two systems is that adaptive speed control remains engaged below 32 km/h (20 mph) and uses the brakes to slow the vehicle, to a halt if necessary.</p>
<p>If adaptive speed control is suspended by pressing the cancel 'CAN' switch, the brake pedal, or the clutch pedal (vehicles with manual transmission), it can be re-engaged by pressing the resume 'RES' switch once the vehicle speed is above 10 km/h (6 mph).</p>
<p>The adaptive speed control system utilizes the following main components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Adaptive Speed Control Module (ASCM)</li>
<li>Right steering wheel switchpack switches</li>
<li>Powertrain Control Module (PCM)</li>
<li>Electric throttle</li>
<li>Fuel Injectors</li>
<li>Anti-lock Brake System control module (ABS) control module and Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU)</li>
<li>Adaptive speed control warning indicator (in the instrument cluster)</li>
<li>Forward alert warning indicator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adaptive speed control system uses a forward looking radar sensor (integrated in the ASCM) to scan the road ahead, looking for objects that are moving at a different rate to itself. When a target is identified, the adaptive speed control system will monitor the time gap between itself and the target vehicle. When the gap falls below a set driver selected level, the adaptive speed control system will intervene, slowing the vehicle by backing off the throttle and/or applying the brakes, until the correct gap is attained. The driver can chose between four gap settings, 1, 1.4, 1.8 and 2.2 seconds.</p>
<p>Adaptive speed control is active when the vehicle is moving. Adaptive speed control only functions when a set speed is entered via the operation of the SET '+' switch. The adaptive speed control system only intervenes with the set speed when it detects a slower target vehicle in the host vehicle's path, and then only if it predicts the time gap will be breached.</p>
<p>The PCM, electric throttle and fuel injection control are unchanged from those used for the standard speed control system.</p>
<p>With the ignition ON (ignition mode 6), the ASCM is powered up but no radar transmissions are emitted until the vehicle is in motion.</p>

</div>
<p>On the approach to, or exit from a bend, a target vehicle may be lost or a new target acquired as vehicles ahead change their angular position with respect to the adaptive speed control module. On a straight road, if the sensing vehicle is in follow mode below its selected set speed, losing the target vehicle will cause the sensing vehicle to accelerate to this set speed. This acceleration is undesirable either on a bend in the road, or entering a bend in the road when the target is suddenly lost, and in this situation the system inhibits the resumption of the set speed.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Follow Mode</p>
<p>A set speed is selected and this speed is maintained until a slower vehicle is encountered in the lane ahead. When the vehicle ahead comes within the effective range of the ASCM radar, the system identifies it as a target vehicle. To indicate that the system is in follow mode, the follow mode warning indicator illuminates in the IC and the current time gap setting is displayed in the message center. When the distance between the two vehicles closes to the set time gap, the adaptive speed control system reduces engine speed and, if necessary, applies the brakes to maintain the set time gap.</p>

<p>Automatic braking is limited to approximately 30% of full pressure (0.3 G deceleration) and is intended to provide a smooth, gradual deceleration in follow mode conditions.</p>

<p>Follow mode is effectively a closed loop system. If several vehicles are ahead, the closest vehicle is chosen as the target to follow. If the target vehicle moves out of the ASCM radar range, or if either vehicle changes lane, the system exits follow mode and extinguishes the follow mode warning indicator. The adaptive speed control system then increases vehicle speed back to the original set speed.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Queue Assist</p>
<p>When adaptive speed control is engaged, if the target vehicle comes to a halt, the ASCM reduces engine speed and applies the brakes to halt the sensing vehicle and suspends speed control operation. The ASCM also applies the Electric Park Brake (EPB) if one of the following occurs:</p>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Adaptive speed control is disengaged with the cancel 'CAN' switch</li>
<li>The vehicle is stationary for more than 2 minutes</li>
<li>Driver exit is detected</li>
<li>A system fault is detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the target vehicle moves away, pressing the accelerator pedal for a minimum of 0.5 second resumes speed control operation. The sensing vehicle then follows the target vehicle in follow mode or until it stops again, or, if it can no longer detect a target, accelerates back up to the set speed.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Forward Alert</p>
<p>If an object is detected close ahead, a warning tone will be emitted from the IC and a message will be displayed in the message center. The brakes will not be applied.</p>
</div>
<p>The forward alert system is active when the warning indicator in the IC is illuminated. Forward alert does not initiate any action, the driver must take the appropriate action when the message is displayed in the message center. The system monitors driver intervention and may not issue the warning if the driver has taken the appropriate action (braking, steering or indicating) early enough.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the warning can be changed using the gap increase and decrease switches when the adaptive cruise control is not engaged. Confirmation of the gap change is given in the message center.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Speed Control Brake system Functions</h2>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Advanced Emergency Brake Assist </p>
<p>Advanced Emergency Brake Assist (AEBA) improves braking response during emergency braking, and is an enhancement of the electronic brake prefill and emergency brake assist functions controlled by the ABS control module. For additional information, refer to: <a href="./G1817848-G1891364.html" data-uid="G1891364" data-proc-uid="G1817848" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Anti-Lock Control - Stability Assist</a> (206-09 Anti-Lock Control - Stability Assist, Description and Operation).</p>
</div>
<p>With AEBA, if the risk of a collision increases after the vehicle passes the forward alert activation threshold, the ASCM signals the ABS control module to activate the electronic brake prefill and emergency brake assist functions. With AEBA, the electronic brake prefill function operates in two stages:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Stage 1:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">Applies a brake pressure of approximately 3 bar (43.5 lbf/in&sup2;) to all of the brakes</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Lowers the AEBA activation threshold in the ABS control module</li>
<li class="dash-subitem">Signals to the BCM/GWM on the High Speed (HS) Controller Area Network (CAN) powertrain systems bus to activate the stop lamps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 2:<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li class="dash-subitem">increases the brake pressure to approximately 10 bar (145 lbf/in&sup2;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 1 is activated if the collision risk increases to a level considered as credible, with the accelerator pedal pressed.</p>
<p>Stage 2 is activated when the accelerator pedal is released during an imminent risk of collision. If the accelerator pedal has already been released when the collision risk increases to the credible level, the two stages of electronic brake prefill are activated simultaneously, to give an immediate brake pressure of 10 bar (145 lbf/in&sup2;).</p>
<p>While the second stage of electronic brake prefill is active, if the brake pedal is then pressed quickly, the ABS control module activates AEBA, even if only light pressure is applied to the pedal.</p>
<p>AEBA is available at vehicle speeds above 7 km/h (5 mph) and will function even when forward alert and adaptive cruise control are switched off.</p>
<p>If a fault occurs in the system, a related message is displayed in the message center. AEBA will not be available until the fault is rectified.</p>
<div class="pf">
<p class="pf-title">Intelligent Emergency Braking</p>
<p>Intelligent emergency braking reduces the impact velocity if the ASCM determines that a collision is unavoidable, even with driver intervention. It is not designed to prevent accidents from occurring. Typical activation of intelligent emergency braking is approximately 0.8 second before impact. During this 0.8 second period the speed of the sensing vehicle is reduced, thus reducing the impact energy.</p>
</div>
<p>If the ASCM determines a collision is unavoidable, it signals the ABS control module to apply emergency brake pressure to all of the brakes. On vehicles without active safety belts, emergency brake pressure is 50 bar (725 lbf/in&sup2;) maximum. On vehicles with active safety belts, emergency brake pressure is 100 bar (1450 lbf/in&sup2;) maximum.</p>
<p>When intelligent emergency braking is initiated the ASCM also signals the Restraints Control Module (RCM) to fire the front seatbelt retractors.For additional information, refer to: <a href="./G1818070-G1892725.html" data-uid="G1892725" data-proc-uid="G1818070" title="Open the procedure inline and add to opened print list" class="inline-procedure-link">Seatbelt System</a> (501-20A Seatbelt System, Description and Operation).</p>
<p>After the intelligent emergency braking function has activated, it is then disabled, as the vehicle is assumed to be damaged. After the vehicle has been repaired, the intelligent emergency braking function can be re-enabled using Jaguar approved diagnostic equipment.</p>
<p>The intelligent emergency braking function operates down to a vehicle speed of 10 km/h (6 mph), and will function even when forward alert and adaptive cruise control are switched off.</p>
<p>If the intelligent emergency braking feature is disabled for any reason, a related message is displayed in the message center.</p>
